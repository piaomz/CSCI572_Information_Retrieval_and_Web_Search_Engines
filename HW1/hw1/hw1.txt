From my queries data, the average percent overlap and the average Spearman coefficient are 20.8% and -10.09 respectively. 

The result indicates that there is a huge difference between the search engine algorithm of Google and Duckduckgo.
These numbers cannot certify which search engine is better or worse, but can only show extremely different algorithms ave adopted.

However, if we use Google as our standard of relevance, the Duckduckgo may seem very bad. 
Only 2 in average of the top 10 queries are matched. 
And from the spearman coefficient, it becomes much worse. 
Since the coefficient of a Search Engine with totally different (0 match) queries is 0, while, for Duckduckgo is -10.09.
Thus, Duckduckgo's query results have a very negative monotonic relationship with the standard, indicating that its has a bad algorithm.
